### Part1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
:cloud:  
I hope to use the line elements of the following work as a source of inspiration.   
The design of Jerry in the movie Soul was inspired by Picassoâ€™s line elements. In the film, the solid lines transform into particle motion and eventually return to their original line forms.   
I believe that by combining the effects of line and particle motion, it is possible to achieve the necessary techniques for the task, thereby bringing an interactive experience and creative visual effects to the work.
